                <h2>Club History</h2>
                <p>
                    Established in 1987, West Wight Archery Club has been dedicated to promoting the sport of archery on the Isle of Wight. Our journey began with outdoor shooting at Calbourne and indoor sessions at the Brighstone Scout Hut.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As our club grew, we expanded our indoor range to the Newport Drill Hall, while still keeping the Brighstone location exclusively for our junior members. However, due to development plans, we had to find a new outdoor range in 1994, as Calbourne was shared with football and cricket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1995, we found our present home at the Medina Leisure Centre, which has provided us with enhanced flexibility. We now enjoy shooting four days a week during the summer and weekends throughout the winter season.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2021, we relocated our indoor range to the Island Riding Centre in Newport, offering us the opportunity to shoot at distances of up to 30 meters indoors.
