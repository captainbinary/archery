                <h2>West Wight Archery Club is a small friendly target archery club based in Newport on the Isle of Wight</h2>

                <p>
                    Welcome to the West Wight Archery Club! We are a small and friendly community of archery enthusiasts, ranging from beginners to seasoned experts, united by our love for the ancient sport of archery. Whether you're looking to learn the fundamentals, improve your skills, or simply enjoy the thrill of hitting the bullseye, our club offers a welcoming and supportive environment for archers of all levels.<br /><br />

                    At our target archery club, we embrace the timeless discipline of shooting arrows at stationary targets. With carefully measured distances, standardized target faces, and a variety of bows and arrows, target archery offers a structured and competitive approach to the sport.<br /><br />

                    We are also affiliated to Archery GB and the Southern Counties Archery Association.

                <h2>Where do we shoot?</h2>

                <p>
                    Our shooting locations vary with the seasons and specific days of the week.<br /><br />

                    During the summer months, we take aim outdoors at the Medina Leisure Centre every Saturday throughout the year (weather permitting).  Additionally, in the summer, we also shoot on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, and occasionally on Sundays and bank holidays, based on interest and participation.<br /><br />

                    As the winter season sets in, we transition to shooting at the Island Riding Centre on Thursday evenings.
